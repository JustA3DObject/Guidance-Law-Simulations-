# PLATO
PLATO is a novel model for controlling speed profile of an AUV in it's "homing" state. Combined with different guidance laws to correct cross-track error and heading error, PLATO can bring an AUV to it's dock with a minimum required velocity countring the current disturbances and the speed of the dock it self. 
The repository contains two different MATLAB scipts to simualte AUV homing mission.
One contains PLATO combined with LOS, Pure Pursuit with Cascaded Control and Pure Pursuit with Integrated Control. 
The results are generated with two different heading angles, 45 and 225.
